## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Animation
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge was another simple training of my skills. This time I managed to make responsive design. I also added a few transitions for hover and click events to my taste and also simple animation that I made myself, without using any libraries, but I took the animista animation from previous challenge solution as an example.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
@keyframes animation {
    0% {
        -webkit-transform: translateY(-100px);
        transform: translateY(-100px);
    }
    100% {
        -webkit-transform: translateY(0px); 
        transform: translateY(0px);
    }
}
```

### Continued development

Next time I'll make a more complicated challenge and will add more animation. I'm learning JS and hope to apply it within next two weeks.
